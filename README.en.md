## 📖 Introduction

**Hyac** is a powerful full-stack Function as a Service (FaaS) platform designed to provide an efficient, scalable, and user-friendly cloud-native development environment. It allows developers to quickly deploy, manage, and execute serverless functions, greatly simplifying the workflow from development to production.


## 🌐 Online Access

- **Project Demo**: https://console.hyacos.top
  - Default username: `admin`, Default password: `admin123`
- **Project Documentation**: https://docs.hyacos.top
## ✨ Key Features

- 🚀 **Dynamic Function Execution**: Dynamically load and execute function code in isolated Docker containers.
- 🔥 **Hot Code-Swapping**: Real-time updates of function code without service restarts.
- 🌐 **Multi-language Support**: Extensibility based on runtimes allows for future support of multiple programming languages.
- 💻 **Modern Frontend**: Built with Vue 3 and Naive UI, providing a responsive, user-friendly management interface.
- 📦 **Unified Object Storage**: Integrated with MinIO to provide unified file storage for functions and applications.
- 🔗 **Comprehensive API**: Offers a rich set of APIs for managing applications, functions, databases, logs, etc.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

Hyac adopts a microservices architecture based on Docker Compose, where various components work together to form an efficient FaaS ecosystem.

- **`traefik`**: Acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer, handling all external requests and automatically routing them to the `server`, `web`, or `minio` services based on the domain.
- **`server`**: The core backend service, responsible for business logic, API routing, user authentication, and FaaS application management.
- **`app`**: The function executor service, which dynamically executes user-defined functions in an isolated environment.
- **`web`**: A Vue 3-based frontend application that provides the user interface.
- **`mongodb`**: Serves as the primary database, storing core data such as applications, functions, and users.
- **`minio`**: Used for object storage, for instance, to store function code, dependencies, or other files.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.10+, FastAPI, Beanie (Motor), Loguru
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3, Vite, Naive UI, Pinia, UnoCSS, TypeScript
- **Database & Storage**: MongoDB, MinIO
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose

## 🚀 Getting Started
